# stalbum

`stalbum` is a static image gallery generator. It simply takes in a directory of images and a couple of templates based on which it constructs a gallery. The gallery consists of albums (maps to directory) that are displayed using thumbnails.

See `demo/` to get started. Alternatively you can just clone [stalbum-demo](https://github.com/bebraw/stalbum-demo) and build your albums on top of that.

## Dependencies

* Node.js (0.10.x is guaranteed to work, earlier might work as well)
* `npm install` the rest
* ImageMagick (for thumbnails)

## License

stalbum is available under MIT. See LICENSE for more details.
